# In-Vehicle-Coupon-Recommendation-KNN-Analysis
CS105 (Data Analysis Methods Final Group Project)

PROJECT PROPOSAL: 
Our project's main objective is to examine a dataset that was gathered using an Amazon
Mechanical Turk survey. The poll includes numerous driving scenarios with details about the location, time, weather, whether a passenger is present, and other pertinent information. If they were the driver in each situation, the participants were asked to indicate whether they would accept a coupon.
In this project, we want to investigate the connection between driving situations and drivers' acceptance of coupons. We aim to comprehend the variables that affect drivers' decision-making processes when it comes to taking coupons by examining the dataset.
We plan to employ advanced machine learning techniques to develop our predictive model. Some of the techniques we will explore include:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To begin, we will thoroughly explore the dataset, looking at its distributions, relationships, and any patterns or anomalies that may be present. EDA will give us information on the qualities of the data and assist us in locating potential interesting variables.
2. Classification Algorithms: We will test several different categorization algorithms, including k nearest neighbors. We will choose the most appropriate algorithm for forecasting students' dropout and academic success by comparing their performance measures.
3. Model Validation and assessment: To evaluate the effectiveness of our predictive model, we will use relevant assessment measures like accuracy, precision, and recall. We'll use cross-validation methods to test the model's performance on hypothetical data.

//This experiment examines the relationship between driving scenarios and drivers'
acceptance of coupons. The dataset was obtained through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Three theories have been developed to direct our inquiry. First, we propose that the acceptance of coupons is greatly influenced by the driving scenario's destination. Drivers may be more likely to take coupons at some locations than others. Second, we expect that weather influences coupon acceptance, with elements like rain, snow, or extremely cold temperatures possibly influencing drivers' choices. Finally, we propose that the acceptance of coupons is influenced by the presence of a passenger in the car. We anticipate that when a passenger is present, drivers might be more inclined to accept coupons.
We hope to learn important things about what influences drivers' decisions about accepting coupons through testing these hypotheses and data analysis. These discoveries may have consequences for marketing, transportation, and consumer behavior research, among other fields.
